    "\n",
    "This setup works like any other function, except that `inner()` can only be invoked from within `outer()`. In this context, `inner()` is a private tool of `outer()` – no other part of the code can access it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `inner()` function returns the value of the variable `loc`, which is accessible within its scope. `inner()` can use any entities available to `outer()`.\n",
    "- The `outer()` function returns the `inner()` function itself. More precisely, it returns a copy of the `inner()` function, which was frozen at the moment of `outer()`'s invocation. This frozen function contains its entire environment, including the state of all local variables. This means that the value of `loc` is retained successfully, even though `outer()` no longer exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the code is fully valid and outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",

    "1. **Iterator**:\n",
    "   - An iterator is an object of a class that provides at least two methods (excluding the constructor):\n",
    "     - `__iter__()`: Called once when the iterator is created and returns the iterator object itself.\n",
    "     - `__next__()`: Called to provide the next value in the iteration and raises the `StopIteration` exception when the iteration ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The `yield` Statement**:\n",
    "   - The `yield` statement can only be used inside functions. It suspends the function’s execution and returns the `yield` argument as a result. Such a function cannot be invoked in a regular way—it is meant to be used as a generator (e.g., in a context that requires a series of values, like a `for` loop).\n",
