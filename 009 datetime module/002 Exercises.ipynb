    "\n",
    "#### Scenario\n",
    "During this course, you learned about the `strftime` method, which requires knowledge of directives to create a format. It's time to put the known directives into practice. Additionally, you'll have the opportunity to practice working with documentation to find directives that you don't yet know.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task\n",
    "Write a program that creates a `datetime` object for November 4, 2020, at 14:53:00. The object should call the `strftime` method with the appropriate format to display the following result:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2020/11/04 14:53:00\n",
    "20/November/04 14:53:00 PM\n",
    "Wed, 2020 Nov 04\n",
    "Wednesday, 2020 November 04\n",
    "Weekday: 3\n",
    "Day of the year: 309\n",
    "Week number of the year: 44\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Each result line should be created by calling the `strftime` method with at least one directive in the format argument."
