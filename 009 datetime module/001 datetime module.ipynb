    "### Introduction to the datetime Module\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you'll explore a Python module called `datetime`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, this module provides classes for handling dates and times. If you think this topic might not be relevant to you, consider these examples of how dates and times are used in programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Event Logging:** Knowing the date and time allows us to pinpoint exactly when a critical error occurs in our application. When creating logs, you can specify the format for date and time.\n",
    "- **Tracking Changes in Databases:** Sometimes it's essential to store information about when a record was created or modified. The `datetime` module is ideal for this purpose.\n",
    "- **Data Validation:** You'll soon learn how to read the current date and time in Python. With this knowledge, you can validate various types of data, such as checking if a discount coupon entered by a user is still valid.\n",
    "- **Storing Important Information:** Imagine bank transfers without recording the date and time they were made. Certain actions require timestamps, and we need to handle this properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Date and time are integral to many aspects of our lives, so understanding the Python `datetime` module is crucial. Are you ready to dive into this new knowledge?"

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a Date Object:**\n",
    "   To create a `date` object, you must pass the year, month, and day arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from datetime import date\n",
    "\n",
    "   my_date = date(2020, 9, 29)\n",
    "   print(\"Year:\", my_date.year)  # Year: 2020\n",
    "   print(\"Month:\", my_date.month)  # Month: 9\n",
    "   print(\"Day:\", my_date.day)  # Day: 29\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `date` object has three read-only attributes: `year`, `month`, and `day`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Getting the Current Date:**\n",
    "   The `today` method returns a `date` object representing the current local date:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from datetime import date\n",
    "   print(\"Today:\", date.today())  # Displays: Today: 2020-09-29\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating a Date Object from a Timestamp:**\n",
    "   In Unix, a timestamp expresses the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC). To create a `date` object from a timestamp, use the `fromtimestamp` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from datetime import date\n",
    "   import time\n",
    "\n",
    "   timestamp = time.time()\n",
    "   d = date.fromtimestamp(timestamp)\n",
    "   print(d)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Note: The `time` function returns the number of seconds from January 1, 1970, to the current moment as a float number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating a Time Object:**\n",
    "   The constructor of the `time` class accepts six arguments (`hour`, `minute`, `second`, `microsecond`, `tzinfo`, and `fold`). Each of these arguments is optional:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from datetime import time\n",
    "\n",
    "   t = time(13, 22, 20)\n",
    "\n",
    "   print(\"Hour:\", t.hour)  # Hour: 13\n",
    "   print(\"Minute:\", t.minute)  # Minute: 22\n",
    "   print(\"Second:\", t.second)  # Second: 20\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Using the Sleep Function:**\n",
    "   The `time` module contains the `sleep` function, which suspends program execution for a given number of seconds:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import time\n",
    "\n",
    "   time.sleep(10)\n",
    "   print(\"Hello world!\")  # This text will be displayed after 10 seconds.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Creating a Datetime Object:**\n",
    "   In the `datetime` module, date and time can be represented either as separate objects or as one object. The class that combines date and time is called `datetime`. All arguments passed to the constructor go to read-only class attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from datetime import datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "   dt = datetime(2020, 9, 29, 13, 51)\n",
    "   print(\"Datetime:\", dt)  # Displays: Datetime: 2020-09-29 13:51:00\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Formatting Date and Time:**\n",
    "   The `strftime` method takes one argument in the form of a string specifying a format that can consist of directives. Some useful directives include:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `%Y` â€“ returns the year with the century as a decimal number.\n",
    "   - `%m` â€“ returns the month as a zero-padded decimal number.\n",
    "   - `%d` â€“ returns the day as a zero-padded decimal number.\n",
    "   - `%H` â€“ returns the hour as a zero-padded decimal number.\n",
    "   - `%M` â€“ returns the minute as a zero-padded decimal number.\n",
    "   - `%S` â€“ returns the second as a zero-padded decimal number.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from datetime import date\n",
    "\n",
    "   d = date(2020, 9, 29)\n",
    "   print(d.strftime('%Y/%m/%d'))  # Displays: 2020/09/29\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Date and Datetime Calculations:**\n",
    "   It's possible to perform calculations on `date` and `datetime` objects. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from datetime import date\n",
    "\n",
    "   d1 = date(2020, 11, 4)\n",
    "   d2 = date(2019, 11, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "   d = d1 - d2\n",
    "   print(d)  # Displays: 366 days, 0:00:00.\n",
    "   print(d * 2)  # Displays: 732 days, 0:00:00.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   The result of the subtraction is returned as a `timedelta` object that expresses the difference in days between the two dates. The `timedelta` object can be used for further calculations, such as multiplication."
