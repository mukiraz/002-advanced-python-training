    "\n",
    "#### Scenario\n",
    "Extend the functionality of the `Calendar` class by adding a new method called `count_weekday_in_year`, which takes a year and a weekday as parameters and returns the number of occurrences of a specific weekday in that year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips:\n",
    "- Create a class called `MyCalendar` that extends the `Calendar` class.\n",
    "- Create the `count_weekday_in_year` method with the `year` and `weekday` parameters. The `weekday` parameter should be a value between 0-6, where 0 is Monday and 6 is Sunday. The method should return the number of days as an integer.\n",
    "- Use the `monthdays2calendar` method of the `Calendar` class in your implementation."
