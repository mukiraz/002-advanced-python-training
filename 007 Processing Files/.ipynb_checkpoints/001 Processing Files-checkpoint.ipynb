    "### Accessing Files from Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "One common task for developers is processing data stored in files, which are typically kept on various storage devices such as hard drives, optical discs, network storage, or solid-state drives.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy to envision a program that sorts 20 numbers, with the user entering these numbers directly from the keyboard. However, the task becomes significantly more complex when dealing with 20,000 numbers, as it's impractical for a user to enter such a large amount of data without errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, it's much easier to imagine these numbers being stored in a disk file that the program reads. The program sorts the numbers and then saves the sorted sequence to a new file, rather than displaying it on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if we want to implement a simple database, the only way to retain information between program runs is to save it into a file (or multiple files for a more complex database).\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, any non-trivial programming problem involves using files, whether it’s processing images, multiplying matrices, or calculating wages and taxes—all these tasks involve reading and writing data stored in files.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Concept of File Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder why we haven't addressed these issues earlier. The reason is straightforward—Python's method for accessing and processing files is built around a consistent set of objects, making this the ideal time to discuss it."

    "\n",
    "Different operating systems handle files in different ways. For example, Windows uses a different naming convention compared to Unix/Linux systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the concept of a canonical file name (a name that uniquely defines the location of the file regardless of its position in the directory tree), we can see that these names appear differently in Windows and Unix/Linux systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Concept of File Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix/Linux systems do not use disk drive letters (like C:). All directories branch out from a single root directory called `/`, while Windows systems recognize the root directory as `\\`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, file names in Unix/Linux systems are case-sensitive. Windows systems store the case of the letters in the file name but do not distinguish between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the strings \"ThisIsTheNameOfTheFile\" and \"thisisthenameofthefile\" refer to two different files in Unix/Linux systems but refer to the same file in Windows systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most notable difference is the use of different separators for directory names: `\\` in Windows and `/` in Unix/Linux. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this difference might not be significant for the average user, it is crucial when writing programs in Python. To understand why, consider the specific role of the `\\` character in Python strings."

    "\n",
    "In fact, it's not strange at all, but quite obvious and natural. Python uses the backslash (`\\`) as an escape character (like `\\n`).\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that Windows file names must be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"\\\\dir\\\\file\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Any program written in Python (and not only in Python, as this convention applies to virtually all programming languages) does not communicate with the files directly, but through abstract entities named differently in various languages or environments—the most common terms are handles or streams (we'll use them as synonyms here).\n",
    "\n",
    "The programmer, having a set of functions/methods, can perform certain operations on the stream, which affect the real files using mechanisms contained in the operating system kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, you can implement the process of accessing any file, even when the file name is unknown at the time of writing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing Files - A Tree Structure Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect (bind) the stream with the file, it's necessary to perform an explicit operation. The operation of connecting the stream with a file is called opening the file, while disconnecting this link is called closing the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the conclusion is that the very first operation performed on the stream is always open, and the last one is close. The program, in effect, is free to manipulate the stream between these two events and to handle the associated file.\n",
    "\n",
    "This freedom is limited, of course, by the physical characteristics of the file and the way in which the file has been opened.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening the stream can fail for several reasons: the most common is the absence of a file with the specified name. \n",
    "\n",
    "It can also happen that the physical file exists, but the program is not allowed to open it. There's also the risk that the program has opened too many streams, and the specific operating system may not allow the simultaneous opening of more than a certain number of files (e.g., 200).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Opening a stream is not only associated with the file but also involves declaring how the stream will be processed. This declaration is known as the open mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the opening is successful, the program can only perform operations that are consistent with the declared open mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic operations performed on the stream:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Read from the stream:** Portions of data are retrieved from the file and placed in a memory area managed by the program (e.g., a variable).\n",
    "- **Write to the stream:** Portions of data from the memory (e.g., a variable) are transferred to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three basic modes used to open the stream:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Read mode:** A stream opened in this mode allows only read operations. Trying to write to the stream will cause an exception (UnsupportedOperation, which inherits from OSError and ValueError, from the `io` module).\n",
    "- **Write mode:** A stream opened in this mode allows only write operations. Attempting to read from the stream will cause the aforementioned exception.\n",
    "- **Update mode:** A stream opened in this mode allows both read and write operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we discuss how to manipulate the streams, some explanation is needed. The stream behaves almost like a tape recorder.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you read something from a stream, a virtual head moves over the stream according to the number of bytes transferred from the stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you write something to the stream, the same head moves along the stream, recording the data from the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we talk about reading from and writing to the stream, try to imagine this analogy. Programming books refer to this mechanism as the current file position, and we will use this term as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "Due to the type of the stream's contents, all streams are divided into text and binary streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Text streams** are structured in lines; they contain typographical characters (letters, digits, punctuation, etc.) arranged in rows (lines), as seen when you view the file contents in an editor. These files are typically written to or read from character by character or line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary streams** do not contain text but rather a sequence of bytes of any value. This sequence can represent an executable program, an image, an audio or video clip, a database file, etc. Because these files do not contain lines, reading and writing relate to portions of data of any size, usually done byte by byte or block by block, with the block size ranging from one to an arbitrarily chosen value.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subtle problem arises with text streams. In Unix/Linux systems, line endings are marked by a single character named LF (Line Feed, ASCII code 10), represented in Python as `\\n`. In contrast, other operating systems, particularly those derived from the prehistoric CP/M system (including Windows), use a different convention: the end of a line is marked by a pair of characters, CR (Carriage Return, ASCII code 13) and LF (Line Feed, ASCII code 10), which can be encoded as `\\r\\n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text vs. Binary Streams Concept\n",

However, the same program running in a Unix/Linux environment will be completely useless, and vice versa. A program written for Unix/Linux systems might not work correctly on Windows.\n",

However, in a Windows environment, newline character translation occurs: when reading a line, every pair of `\\r\\n` characters is replaced with a single `\\n` character, and vice versa during writing—every `\\n` character is replaced with a pair of `\\r\\n` characters.\n",
    "- This mechanism is completely transparent to the program, allowing it to be written as if it were intended solely for Unix/Linux text files. The same source code will also work correctly in a Windows environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "The function is `strerror()`, which comes from the `os` module and expects just one argument—an error number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its role is simple: you provide an error number, and it returns a string describing the meaning of the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you pass a non-existent error code (a number not bound to any actual error), the function will raise a `ValueError` exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can simplify our code as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from os import strerror\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    s = open(\"c:/users/user/Desktop/file.txt\", \"rt\")\n",
    "    # Actual processing goes here.\n",
    "    s.close()\n",
    "except Exception as exc:\n",
    "    print(\"The file could not be opened:\", strerror(exc.errno))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright. Now it's time to deal with text files and get familiar with some basic techniques you can use to process them."

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A file needs to be opened before it can be processed by a program, and it should be closed when processing is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Opening the file associates it with a stream, an abstract representation of the physical data stored on the media. The way in which the stream is processed is called the open mode. There are three open modes:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Read mode** – only read operations are allowed.\n",
    "   - **Write mode** – only write operations are allowed.\n",
    "   - **Update mode** – both write and read operations are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Depending on the physical file content, different Python classes can be used to process files. Generally, `BufferedIOBase` can process any file, while `TextIOBase` is specialized for processing text files (i.e., files containing human-readable text divided into lines using newline markers). Thus, streams can be divided into binary and text streams.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The following `open()` function syntax is used to open a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   open(file_name, mode=open_mode, encoding=text_encoding)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   This invocation creates a stream object and associates it with the file named `file_name`, using the specified `open_mode` and setting the specified `text_encoding`. If there is an error, it raises an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Three predefined streams are already open when the program starts:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `sys.stdin` – standard input\n",
    "   - `sys.stdout` – standard output\n",
    "   - `sys.stderr` – standard error output\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The `IOError` exception object, created when any file operation fails (including open operations), contains a property named `errno`, which holds the error code of the failed action. Use this value to diagnose the problem."
