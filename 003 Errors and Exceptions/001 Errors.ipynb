    "## **Exceptions**\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Each time your code tries to do something wrong, foolish, irresponsible, crazy, or unenforceable, Python does two things:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. It stops your program.\r\n",
    "2. It creates a special kind of data called an exception.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Both of these activities are referred to as raising an exception. We can say that Python always raises an exception (or that an exception has been raised) when it has no idea how to proceed with your code.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "What happens next?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. The raised exception expects somebody or something to notice it and take care of it.\r\n",
    "2. If nothing happens to handle the raised exception, the program will be forcibly terminated, and you will see an error message sent to the console by Python.\r\n",
    "3. If the exception is properly handled, the suspended program can be resumed and its execution can continue.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Python provides effective tools that allow you to observe exceptions, identify them, and handle them efficiently. This is possible because all potential exceptions have unique names, so you can categorize and react to them appropriately.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**The Concept of Exceptions**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You already know some exception names. Take a look at the following diagnostic message:\r\n",

    "### Summary\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Exception Handling Basics:**\r\n",
    "   - An exception is an event during program execution caused by an abnormal situation. Exceptions should be handled to avoid the termination of the program. The part of your code that is suspected of being the source of the exception should be placed inside the `try` block.\r\n",
    "   - When an exception occurs, the execution of the code does not terminate but instead jumps into the `except` block. This is where the handling of the exception should take place. The general structure for such a construction looks as follows:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   # The code that always runs smoothly.\r\n",
    "   :\r\n",
    "   try:\r\n",
    "       # Risky code.\r\n",
    "       :\r\n",
    "   except:\r\n",
    "       # Crisis management takes place here.\r\n",
    "       : \r\n",
    "   # Back to normal.\r\n",
    "   :\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Handling Multiple Exceptions:**\r\n",
    "   - If you need to handle more than one exception coming from the same `try` block, you can add more than one `except` block, but you must label them with different exception names, like this:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   # The code that always runs smoothly.\r\n",
    "   :\r\n",
    "   try:\r\n",
    "       # Risky code.\r\n",
    "       :\r\n",
    "   except Except_1:\r\n",
    "       # Crisis management takes place here.\r\n",
    "       :\r\n",
    "   except Except_2:\r\n",
    "       # We save the world here.\r\n",
    "       :\r\n",
    "   # Back to normal.\r\n",
    "   :\r\n",
    "   ```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   - At most, one of the `except` blocks is executed. None of the blocks are executed if the raised exception doesn't match any of the specified exceptions.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Anonymous Except Branch:**\r\n",
    "   - You cannot add more than one anonymous (unnamed) `except` block after the named ones.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   ```python\r\n",
    "   # The code that always runs smoothly.\r\n",
    "   :\r\n",
    "   try:\r\n",
    "       # Risky code.\r\n",
    "       :\r\n",
    "   except Except_1:\r\n",
    "       # Crisis management takes place here.\r\n",
    "       :\r\n",
    "   except Except_2:\r\n",
    "       # We save the world here.\r\n",
    "       :\r\n",
    "   except:\r\n",
    "       # All other issues fall here.\r\n",
    "       :\r\n",
    "   # Back to normal.\r\n",
    "   :\r\n",
