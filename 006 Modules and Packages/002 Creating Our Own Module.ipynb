    "In this section, you'll be working locally on your machine. Let's start from the beginning. Create an empty file named `module.py`:\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "You'll need two files for these experiments. The first file, `module.py`, is currently empty, but don't worry—you'll be filling it with actual code soon. We've named it `module.py` because it's simple and clear.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Your First Module: Step 2\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The second file, `main.py`, will use the new module. Its initial content is brief:\r\n",

    "#### Creating a main.py File with the Import Module Instruction\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "import module\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### Note:\r\n",
    "Both files must be in the same folder. We recommend creating a new, empty folder for both files to make things easier.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Open IDLE (or any other IDE you prefer) and run the `main.py` file. What do you see?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You should see nothing. This indicates that Python has successfully imported the contents of the `module.py` file, even though it's currently empty. This is the first step. Before moving on, check the folder containing both files.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Do you notice something interesting?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A new subfolder named `__pycache__` has appeared. Inside, you'll find a file named something like `module.cpython-xy.pyc`, where `x` and `y` are digits corresponding to your Python version (e.g., 3 and 8 for Python 3.8).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The file name mirrors your module's name (`module` here). The part after the first dot indicates which Python implementation created the file (CPython here) and its version. The last part, `pyc`, stands for Python compiled.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You can open the file, but its contents will be unreadable to humans because it's intended solely for Python's use.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "When Python imports a module for the first time, it translates its contents into a semi-compiled form. This file doesn't contain machine code but internal Python semi-compiled code, ready to be executed by Python's interpreter. This allows for faster execution, as it skips many checks needed for a pure source file.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "As a result, subsequent imports of the module will be quicker than interpreting the source text from scratch.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Python can detect if the module's source file has been modified. If it has, the `pyc` file will be rebuilt. If not, the `pyc` file can be run immediately. This process is automatic and transparent, so you don't need to worry about it."

    "\n",
    "Unlike many other programming languages, Python doesn't allow you to hide variables from module users.

    "\n",
    "Let's make our example a bit more complex. Up until now, we've assumed that the main Python file and the module it imports are located in the same folder. Let's change this assumption and consider the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We are using Windows® OS (this is important as the file path format depends on the OS).\n",
    "- The main Python script is located in `C:\\Users\\user\\py\\progs` and is named `main.py`.\n",
    "- The module to be imported is located in `C:\\Users\\user\\py\\modules`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Python Searches for Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how to handle this scenario, we need to discuss how Python searches for modules. Python uses a special variable (actually a list) that stores all the locations (folders) it searches to find a requested module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python looks through these folders in the order they appear in the list. If the module isn't found in any of these directories, the import fails. If it finds a module with the desired name, it stops searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "This variable is called `path`, and it's accessible through the `sys` module. Here's how you can check its current value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "\n",
    "for p in sys.path:\n",
    "    print(p)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run this code from the `C:\\Users\\user` directory, we get output similar to this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "C:\\Users\\user\n",
    "C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32\\python36.zip\n",
    "C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32\\DLLs\n",
    "C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32\\lib\n",
    "C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32\n",
    "C:\\Users\\user\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python36-32\\lib\\site-packages\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The first element in the path list is the directory where the execution starts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that a zip file is listed as a path element. This is not an error. Python can treat zip files like regular folders, which can save storage space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solving the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve our problem, we can add the folder containing the module to the `path` variable (it is fully modifiable).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your First Module: Step 12\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible solution is to modify the `main.py` file as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Updating the `main.py` File\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sys import path\n",
    "\n",
    "path.append('..\\\\modules')\n",
    "\n",
    "import module\n",
    "\n",
    "zeroes = [0 for i in range(5)]\n",
    "ones = [1 for i in range(5)]\n",
    "print(module.suml(zeroes))\n",
    "print(module.prodl(ones))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Doubling the Backslashes:** We've doubled the `\\` in the folder name. This is necessary because a single backslash is an escape character in Python strings.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Relative Folder Name:** We've used a relative path for the folder. This will work if you start the `main.py` file from its home directory. If the current directory doesn't match the relative path, you can use an absolute path instead, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    path.append('C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\py\\\\modules')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using `append()`:** We've used the `append()` method, which adds the new path as the last element in the `path` list. If you prefer to place it elsewhere in the list, you can use `insert()` instead."
