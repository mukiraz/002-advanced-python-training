    "This is crucial to understand, as it implies that certain familiar behaviors should be expected from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze the code in the editor to illustrate what we're discussing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at Example 1. The `len()` function, when used on strings, returns the number of characters contained within the argument. The snippet outputs 2.\n",
    "Any string can be empty. Its length would then be 0, as demonstrated in Example 2.\n",
    "Don't forget that a backslash (`\\`) used as an escape character is not counted in the string's total length. Consequently, the code in Example 3 outputs 3.\n",
    "Run the three example codes to verify this."

    "## Multiline Strings\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now is an excellent time to introduce another way of specifying strings in Python source code. The syntax you are already familiar with does not allow a string to span more than one line.\r\n",

    "For instance, the following code is erroneous:\r\n",

    "Line #2'\r\n",

    "multiline = '''Line #1\r\n",
    "Line #2'''\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "print(len(multiline))\r\n",
    "```\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "As you can see, the string begins with three apostrophes instead of one. The same triple apostrophe is used to terminate it.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "You can include any number of text lines within such a string.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The snippet outputs 15.\r\n",

    "Count the characters carefully. Is this result correct or not? Initially, it seems okay, but upon counting the characters, it doesn't add up.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Line #1 contains seven characters. Two such lines make up 14 characters. Did we miss a character? Where? How?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "No, we didn't.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The missing character is simply invisible - it's a whitespace. It's located between the two text lines.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "It's denoted as: `\\n`.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Remember? It's a special (control) character used to force a line feed (hence its name: LF). You can't see it, but it counts.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Multiline strings can also be delimited by triple quotes, like this:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "```python\r\n",
    "multiline = \"\"\"Line #1\r\n",
    "Line #2\"\"\"\r\n",

    "- Replicated\r\n",

    "The ability to use the same operator for completely different kinds of data (like numbers vs. strings) is called overloading (since the operator is overloaded with different duties).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Consider the example:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- The `+` operator used with two or more strings produces a new string containing all the characters from its arguments (note: the order matters - this overloaded `+` is not commutative, unlike its numerical counterpart).\r\n",
    "- The `*` operator requires a string and a number as arguments; in this case, the order doesn't matter - you can place the number before the string or vice versa, and the result will be the same: a new string created by replicating the argument's strb\r\n",
