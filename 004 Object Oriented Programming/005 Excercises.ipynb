    "\n",
    "## Scenario:\n",
    "We need a class that can count seconds. It may seem simple, but we have specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the requirements carefully as the class you create will be used for launching rockets on international missions to Mars. This is a significant responsibility, and we are relying on you!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your class will be named Timer. The constructor should accept three arguments representing hours (a value in the range [0..23] - military time), minutes (in the range [0..59]), and seconds (in the range [0..59]).\n",
    "\n",
    "The default value for all parameters is zero. There is no need to perform validation checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The class should provide the following features:\n",
    "- Objects of the class should be \"printable,\" meaning they can implicitly convert themselves into strings in the format \"hh:mm:ss,\" with leading zeros added for values less than 10.\n",
    "- The class should have parameterless methods called next_second() and previous_second(), which increment or decrement the time stored in the objects by +1 or -1 second, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints:\n",
    "- All object properties should be private.\n",
    "- Consider writing a separate function (not a method) to format the time string.\n",
