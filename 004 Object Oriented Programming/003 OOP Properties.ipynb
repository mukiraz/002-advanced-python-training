    "In a class, you can define two kinds of data to establish its properties. You've already encountered one of these when we discussed stacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of class property exists only when it is explicitly created and added to an object. This can be done during the object's initialization, typically performed by the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it can be added at any point during the object's lifespan. Additionally, any existing property can be removed at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has some important implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Different objects of the same class may have different sets of properties.\n",
    "2. There must be a way to safely check if a specific object has the property you want to use (unless you want to risk an exception, which might sometimes be worth considering).\n",
    "3. Each object maintains its own set of properties that do not interfere with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "These types of variables (properties) are known as instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"instance\" indicates that they are closely associated with the objects (which are instances of the class), not the classes themselves. Let's examine them more closely.\n",

    "Before we go further, let's clarify one additional point. Consider the last three lines of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python objects are created, they come with a small set of predefined properties and methods. Each object has these, regardless of whether you want them or not. One of these is a variable named `__dict__` (a dictionary).\n",

    "This variable contains the names and values of all the properties (variables) the object currently holds. We can use it to safely display an object's contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's dive into the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The class named `ExampleClass` has a constructor that unconditionally creates an instance variable named `first` and sets it with the value passed through the first argument (from the class user's perspective) or the second argument (from the constructor's perspective). Note the default value of the parameter—any trick you can do with a regular function parameter can be applied to methods, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The class also has a method that creates another instance variable, named `second`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We've created three objects of the class `ExampleClass`, but all these instances differ:\n",
    "   - `example_object_1` only has the property named `first`.\n",
    "   - `example_object_2` has two properties: `first` and `second`.\n",
    "   - `example_object_3` has been given a property named `third` on the fly, outside the class's code—this is both possible and permissible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program's output clearly shows that our assumptions are correct:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{'first': 1}\n",
    "{'second': 3, 'first': 2}\n",
    "{'third': 5, 'first': 4}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one additional conclusion: modifying an instance variable of any object has no impact on all the remaining objects. Instance variables are perfectly isolated from each other."

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Instance Variables**\n",
    "   - An instance variable is a property whose existence depends on the creation of an object. Each object can have a unique set of instance variables.\n",
    "   - Instance variables can be added to and removed from objects during their lifetime. They are stored in a dedicated dictionary named `__dict__` within each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Private Instance Variables**\n",
    "   - An instance variable can be made private by starting its name with double underscores (`__`). However, this property can still be accessed from outside the class using a mangled name, formatted as `_ClassName__PrivatePropertyName`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Class Variables**\n",
    "   - A class variable is a property that exists in a single copy and is accessible without creating an object. These variables are not shown in the `__dict__` content of instances.\n",
    "   - All class variables are stored in a dedicated dictionary named `__dict__`, contained separately within each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using `hasattr()` Function**\n",
    "   - The `hasattr()` function can be used to check if an object or class contains a specified property.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Sample:\n",
    "    gamma = 0  # Class variable.\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.alpha = 1  # Instance variable.\n",
    "        self.__delta = 3  # Private instance variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = Sample()\n",
    "obj.beta = 2  # Another instance variable (exists only in the \"obj\" instance).\n",
    "print(obj.__dict__)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code outputs:\n",
    "\n",
