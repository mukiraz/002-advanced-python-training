    "## Importing a Module\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Making a Module Usable\n",
    "\n",
    "To utilize a module, you need to import it, similar to taking a book off a shelf. This is done using the `import` statement, which is also a keyword with specific implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `import` Keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider you want to use two items from the `math` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A constant representing the value of Ï€ (pi) as precisely as possible using double floating-point arithmetic. Although you can use Greek letters in Python variable names, the constant is named `pi` for convenience, especially for those without Greek keyboards.\n",
    "- A function called `sin()`, which calculates the sine of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these items are in the `math` module, but how you can use them depends on how you import the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importing a Module: Basic Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to import a module is by using the `import` statement like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `import` keyword.\n",
    "- The name of the module you want to import.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can place the `import` statement anywhere in your code, but it must appear before you use any of the module's features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importing Multiple Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to import more than one module, you can either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use separate `import` statements for each module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- List multiple modules in a single `import` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math, sys\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This single statement imports both the `math` and `sys` modules. You can include as many modules as you need in the list."
